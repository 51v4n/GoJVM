The 'newest' part is the callbacks (Java native -> JNI -> CGO -> Go),
so please use care when using


Bugs/ TODO
=========
	- Bad callback function heders can wedge the reflection engine.
	- Callbacks are not all throwing/catching exceptions when they should
	- Callbacks are limited to the number of "GenericX" functions defined
		in the headers and C files (and the matching dispatcher function).
		Ways to make this less hacky are WELCOME!
	- Probably not releasing all references when we should
	- Custom callback types (e.g., children of java/lang/Object) 
		are not yet supported (with the exception of String)
